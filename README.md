# PastanagAPP
Web App built in the challenging deadline of one week, from scratch. Using JS, JQuery, PHP, MySQL, CSS and HTML.

The plan for the platform was to host a game of the popular game "Pastanaga Assassina" ("Killer Carrot") which objective is to stab with a carrot one's victim and then the victim's victim, and so on... Until the cycle ends. Without being seen by other witnesses.

The app has been used as a method to know who to eliminate next, keep track of who eliminated whom, get a ranking of who was getting the most eliminations, see who has been eliminated...

As people were playing, the project kept evolving and offering new features. It has been a great improvement compared to what has been done these last few years, times when the game faded to oblivion because of the players' lack of memorization/interest and the inability of the organizers to keep track of how the game was doing.

Images below are an extract of the actual game played this fall at UPC's Maths and Statistics Faculty (FME).
