# PastanagAPP
Web App built in the challenging deadline of one week from scratch. Using JS, JQuery, PHP, MySQL, CSS and HTML.

The plan for the platform was to host a game of the popular game "Pastanaga Assassina" ("Killer Carrot") which objective is to stab with a carrot the player's victim and then the victim's victim, etc. Without being seen by other witnesses.

The app has been used as a method to know who to eliminate next, keep track of who eliminated whom, get who a ranking of who was getting the most eliminations, see who has been eliminated...

As people were playing, the project kept evolving and offering new features. It has been a great improvement compared to what has been done these last few years, when the game faded to its ending because of the players' lack of memorization/interest and the inability of the organizers to keep track of how the game was doing.
